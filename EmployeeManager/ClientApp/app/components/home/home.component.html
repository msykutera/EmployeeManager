<h1>Employee manager</h1>

<p>
    I created this app to learn Angular 4 and how one can use it with .NET Core 2. 
    It is Single Page App that allows to manage list of employees by executing CRUD operations.
    It uses in memory data store injected by interface, so it could be easily changed to use database. 
    But I didn't want to do that here for simplicity.
